### In development

Added [laboratory observation codes](CodeSystem-observation-lab-research-codes-cs.html) for panels and analytes used in Uzbekistan.

Added [document identifier namespace](identifiers.html#document-identifiers) (doc) to identifier systems.

#### Organization profile changes

`type.coding[organizationType]` in [UZ Core Organization](StructureDefinition-uz-core-organization.html) now uses [OrganizationTypeUZCS](CodeSystem-organization-types-uz-cs.html) instead of the HL7 `organization-type` CodeSystem. For example, `$organization-type-cs#prov` must be replaced with a code from `organization-types-uz-cs` (e.g. `#I` "Distribution by management"). There is no 1:1 mapping - each organization must be classified into the new system (codes I-V).

Added `type.coding[organizationGrouping]` slice to [UZ Core Organization](StructureDefinition-uz-core-organization.html) using [OrganizationGroupingCS](CodeSystem-organization-grouping-uz-cs.html) for detailed facility grouping (e.g. `#104` "Specialized hospitals", `#210` "Family polyclinic"). Implementers should populate this new slice.

`type.coding[organizationalServiceGroup]` and `type.coding[specialization]` cardinality in [UZ Core Organization](StructureDefinition-uz-core-organization.html) widened from 0..1 to 0..\*. Implementers can now send multiple service group and specialization codes per organization.

Added code I_6 "Organizations with foreign investors participation" to [OrganizationalSubordinationGroupCS](CodeSystem-organizational-subordination-group-cs.html). Implementers should use this code in `type.coding[subordinationGroup]` for applicable organizations.

[OrganizationalStructureCS](CodeSystem-organizational-structure-cs.html) expanded with new codes for outpatient facilities (e.g. `#200` polyclinics), educational institutions (`#300`), blood transfusion centers (`#400`), sanepid services (`#500`), and others. Some existing translations corrected (e.g. `#116` fixed from "Medical center center" to "Medical center"). Implementers should review if a more specific code now exists for their facilities.

Added [coverage area extension](StructureDefinition-coverage-area.html) to [UZ Core Organization](StructureDefinition-uz-core-organization.html) for specifying the administrative territory an organization serves, bound to [StateVS](ValueSet-state-vs.html). SSV territory codes can be mapped to StateCS using [SSVAdministrativeTerritoryToRegionsCM](ConceptMap-ssv-administrative-territory-to-regions-cm.html).

Added [example](Organization-xonobod-medical-association.html) demonstrating how to translate a MIS2 JSON organization into a UZ Core Organization resource using the ConceptMaps.

Added ConceptMaps for translating MIS2 codes to UZ Core terminology: [MIS2MedicalTypeToOrganizationalStructureCM](ConceptMap-mis2-medical-type-to-organizational-structure-cm.html) for `type.coding[organizationalStructure]`, [MIS2LevelTypeToSubordinationGroupCM](ConceptMap-mis2-level-type-to-subordination-group-cm.html) for `type.coding[subordinationGroup]`, and [MIS2ServiceTypeToOrganizationalServiceGroupCM](ConceptMap-mis2-service-type-to-organizational-service-group-cm.html) for `type.coding[organizationalServiceGroup]`. Implementers translating from MIS2 should use these maps to populate the corresponding slices.

### Version 0.5.0

In [UZ Core Socioeconomic Observation](StructureDefinition-uz-core-socioeconomic-observation.html), the **BenefitCS** code system has been expanded with new codes (e.g., `#regis0004.00020`, `#regis0004.00021`, `#regis0004.00022`, `#regis0004.00023`).

In [UZ Core Socioeconomic Observation](StructureDefinition-uz-core-socioeconomic-observation.html), new codes have been added to the **EducationCS** code system (e.g., `#regis0005.00011` "No education", `#regis0005.00012` "Specialty").

In [UZ Core Socioeconomic Observation](StructureDefinition-uz-core-socioeconomic-observation.html), the **SocialStatusCS** code system has been expanded (e.g., `#regis0010.00010` "School student", `#regis0010.00011` "Eligible for benefits").

A new term has been added to [DisabilityCS](CodeSystem-disability-cs.html):  
- `#regis0011.00005` "Disability not established"

A new **AdmitSourceLocalCS** code system has been created with the following codes:
- `#mserv-0006-00001` "Without referral / Self-referred"

- `#mserv-0006-00003` "District psychiatry service"
- `#mserv-0006-00004` "Emergency medical service"
- `#mserv-0006-00005` "By court decision"
- `#mserv-0006-00006` "For examination"

A new **AdmissionOriginVS** ValueSet has been created, which includes codes from **AdmitSourceHomeCS**.

[EncounterPriorityCS](CodeSystem-encounter-priority-cs.html) has been expanded with missing codes based on HL7 `v3-ActPriority` (e.g., `#A`, `#CR`, `#EL`, `#R`, `#RR`, `#S`, `#T`, `#UD`, `#UR`).

A new **EncounterPriorityLocalCS** code system has been created with local priority codes (e.g., `#transferred`, `#mandatory-treatment`, `#involuntary-hospitalization`).

A new **ReAdmissionLocalCS** code system has been created for readmission cases (e.g., `#first-time`, `#repeat-current-year`).

[EncounterDischargeDispositionHomeCS](CodeSystem-encounter-discharge-disposition-home-cs.html) has been expanded with new codes:
- `#mserv-0004-00004` "Discharged"
- `#mserv-0004-00002` "Died"
- `#mserv-0004-00005` "Transferred to Ministry of Internal Affairs facility"
- `#mserv-0004-00006` "Moved to a charity home (residential care facility)"

For [UZ Core Condition](StructureDefinition-UZCoreCondition.html), a new **EncounterLocalSubjectStatusCS** code system has been created to represent patient status:
- `#loc-cs-001` "Recovered"
- `#loc-cs-002` "Improved"
- `#loc-cs-003` "Unchanged"
- `#loc-cs-004` "Worsened"

Although there is no dedicated profile for Coverage in UZ Core, a new **CoverageTypeCS** code system has been created due to requirements from SSV forms.  
It includes funding types through DTSJ and social funds (e.g., `#dtsj-treated-case`, `#dtsj-privileged-category`, `#saxovat-komak-fund`, `#womens-notebook-fund`, `#youth-notebook-fund`).
