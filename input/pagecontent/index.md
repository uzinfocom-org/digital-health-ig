# Uzbekistan Digital Health Platform

This FHIR R5 implementation guide (IG) is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use. It is intended for testing and feedback purposes only of the [Digital Health Platform](https://www.kfw.de/About-KfW/Newsroom/Latest-News/Pressemitteilungen-Details_723328.html) (DHP). The content is subject to change as the IG is developed further.

Current priority is on completing the core resource profiles first to enable their implementation in DHP. Afterwards, when sufficient modelling capability is available, the rest of the IG prose will be fleshed out.
