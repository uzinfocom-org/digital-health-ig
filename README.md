## 🛠️ Repository Management and Development Standards

**Semantic versioning**: Version identification follows the conventions documented at https://build.fhir.org/ig/vadi2/DHP-temp/en/index.html#identification-of-versions.

**Branching strategy**: Feature branches are created as needed and merged into the main branch via rebase or squash-commit. All releases are tagged from the main branch according to semantic versioning standards.

**Code review policy**: Pull requests must pass IG Publisher QA checks without introducing new errors or warnings, and require approval from at least one FHIR expert before merging.

**Quality assurance**: Static analysis is enforced through the FHIR IG Publisher's built-in validation and QA tooling, which checks for conformance issues, broken references, terminology validation errors, and a host of other issues.
